aurèce vettier\n\naurèce vettier is an artistic collective founded by Paul Mouginot in 2019. The collective aims at understanding how relevant and meaningful interactions with machines and algorithms can be achieved, in order to push the boundaries of creative processes.\n\n\"The works we produce are the result of a number of forth-and-back trips between the “real” space that we all share, where we can draw, paint, sculpt, break, erase; and the “data” space, where we can play with more dimensions than we can cope with. In this data space, which can involve AI algorithms or heavy mathematical processing we expand the possibilities, explore new forms that we can project back in reality. We then provide new propositions, at the cost of accepting to lose a little bit of information when projecting back in the real space.\"\n\nExperimentation -both physical and digital- is crucial in the collective’s practice, as well as the idea of creating bridges or taking part to exchanges and collaborations.\nPaul was born in 1990, he is an engineer and graduated from CentraleSupélec (France) and ESCP-Europe in 2014.
